Hi everyone, this is Carlo!

I am a **PhD Student** in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Florence.
I was born in the beautiful **Reggio Calabria**, the southernmost city of the Italian peninsula!
In Reggio Calabria, I took my B.Sc and M.Sc in **Information and Communication Technology Engineering** (ICT) at the Mediterranea University. 
<!-- This path lead me through the foundations of Computer Science, Electronics and Physics to get a holistic understanding of what the information is and what we could do. -->
<!-- During the first year of M.Sc I took a course about **Artificial Intelligence**... and you can easily understand how things went after that! -->

The motivations behind my studies are quite different and some are very personal.
Even before getting into Engineering, as a kid my goal was to help the scientific community in the fight against **neuro-degenerative** pathologies (love you Grandma), so my curiosity and determination were fueled by love.
Luckily, I understood in time that to be a doctor was not my true inspiration, whereas I only wanted to stay in the **locked in a lab** to push the scientific progress forward!
Then, completely out of the blue, I remembered one thing that I always did (and still do) since I was a child: I used to have a **notebook** in which I design things like plasma cannons, spaceships, super computers, lightsabers, humanoid robots, and every fantascientific thing that cross my path. At that point, it was obvious to me that I was meant for the Engineering life!

But you may ask "Why Artificial Intelligence?" or "Why Reinforcement Learning?"...
<!-- AI, in general, is the perfect match across all my interests.
We can apply AI to almost every aspect of our life, and if there are some that still are not "**AI-ed**" we are working on how to do that! The idea that we may not even be at the beginning of the AI era gives me "zoomies" every time! -->
To answer the second point, let me ask you something: have you ever heard about **Alan Turing**? Well, if yes, you can easily understand what truly lies behind my zoomies. Questions like "Could ever machines think at some point?", or "what humanity can achive with machines-empowerment?" hold me tight to the chair for hours every day, and this is were Reinforcement Learning kicks in!
Reinforcement Learning is the way to return on my origins by studing the **brain** and the **human behavior**, and look for a way to reproduce and empower them.
  <!-- , in general, to add a little brick into the history of mankind.
It has been demonstrated as one of the most complex learning processes but also one of the most powerful!
Humans and animals are guided by Reinforcement Learning even though we still do not know what is the true **Reward Function**... -->

What can I say more about me?
- I **L O V E** the Lord of the Rings, and after years of re-watch marathons, conferences about LoTR and scraping the LoTR Wiki, this year I committed myself into finally reading all the books. If Gondor calls for aid, Rohan will answer.
- Since Christmas 1999, when I received my PlayStation, I have been a **relentless videogamer**. My problem is that I like challenging games, so yeah... I am "quite" a Souls-like gamer.
- I played guitar for years but my sound was not so rocky as I wanted.. However, during a jam session with friends, I discovered that kicking and hitting things with sticks was my real thing. So after years of dreaming to have a drums set, years spent in hitting sofa pillows with sticks to still learn some fills, this year I finally got my very own **drums set**! I wanna rock.. ROCK!
- During the last year, I played **Dungeons and Dragons** for the first time.. I think that you already discovered the pattern behind all my hobbies.. What are the consequences of adding D&D into my life? Well, 1. new fantasy books to read; 2. tons of manuals to buy; 3. infinite characters to create. Bringing and living fantasy stories into real life with my friends has no price!
