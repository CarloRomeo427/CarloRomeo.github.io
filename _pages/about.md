Hi everyone, this is Carlo!

I am a **PhD Student** in Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) at the University of Florence.
I was born in the beautiful **Reggio Calabria**, the southernmost city of the Italian peninsula!
In Reggio Calabria, I took my B.Sc and M.Sc in **Information and Communication Technology Engineering** (ICT) at the Mediterranea University. 
<!-- This path lead me through the foundations of Computer Science, Electronics and Physics to get a holistic understanding of what the information is and what we could do. -->
<!-- During the first year of M.Sc I took a course about **Artificial Intelligence**... and you can easily understand how things went after that! -->

The reasons behind my studies are quite diverse, and some are very personal.
As a child my goal was to contribute to the fight against **neurodegenerative** diseases (love you Grandma), so my curiosity and determination were fueled by love. Luckily, I realized in time that becoming a doctor wasn't my true aspiration, I just wanted to stay **locked up** with my books!
Then, completely out of the blue, I remembered something I had always done (and still do) since I was a child: I had a **notebook** in which I designed things like plasma cannons, spaceships, lightsabers, and robots. At that point, it became clear to me that I was meant for a life in engineering!

But you might ask "Why Artificial Intelligence?" or "Why Reinforcement Learning?"
<!-- AI, in general, is the perfect match across all my interests.
We can apply AI to almost every aspect of our life, and if there are some that still are not "**AI-ed**" we are working on how to do that! The idea that we may not even be at the beginning of the AI era gives me "zoomies" every time! -->
Let me ask you something: have you ever heard about **Alan Turing**? 
<!-- Well, if yes, you can easily understand what truly lies behind my zoomies.  -->
Questions such as "Can machines ever be able to think?", or "What can humanity achieve thanks to machines?" keep me glued to my chair for hours every day, and this is were Reinforcement Learning kicks in!
**Reinforcement Learning** is a way to return on my roots by studing the **brain** and the **human behavior**, and looking for a way to reproduce and enhance them.
  <!-- , in general, to add a little brick into the history of mankind.
It has been demonstrated as one of the most complex learning processes but also one of the most powerful!
Humans and animals are guided by Reinforcement Learning even though we still do not know what is the true **Reward Function**... -->

What can I say more about me?
- I L-O-V-E the **Lord of the Rings**, and after years of re-watch marathons, conferences about LoTR and scraping the LoTR Wiki, this year I committed to finally reading all the books. If Gondor calls for aid, Rohan will answer.
- Since Christmas 1999, when I received my PlayStation, I have been a relentless **videogamer**. My problem is that I like challenging games, so yeah... I am "quite" a Souls-like gamer.
- Born as a guitarist but, at some point in life, I discovered that kicking and hitting things with sticks was my real thing. So after years spent in hitting sofa pillows with sticks to still learn some fills, this year I finally got my very own **drums** set! I wanna rock.. ROCK!
- During the last year, I played **Dungeons and Dragons** for the first time.. What are the consequences of adding D&D into my life? Well, 1. new fantasy books to read; 2. tons of manuals to buy; 3. infinite characters to create and play. Bringing and living fantasy stories into real life with my friends has no price!
