I was born in the beautiful Reggio Calabria, the southernmost city of the Italian peninsula, in which I took my B.Sc and M.Sc in Information and Communication Technology Engineering (ICT) at the Mediterranea University. This path lead me through the foundations of Computer Science, Electronics and Physics to get a holistic understanding of what the information is and what we could do with it. However, during the first year of M.Sc I took a course about Artificial Intelligence… and you can easily understand how things went after that!</p> <p>The motivations behind my studies are quite different and some are very personal. Even before getting into Engineering, my goal was to study the brain from a Medical point of view, to help humanity fight against neuro-degenerative pathologies (love you Granma). Luckily, I understood in time that to be a doctor and deal with patients was not my true inspiration, whereas I only wanted to stay in the background, locked in a lab to push the scientific progress on the matter! Then, completely out of the blue, I remembered one thing that I always did (and still do) since I was a child: I used to have a notebook in which I design things like plasma cannons, spaceships, super computers, lightsabers, humanoid robots, and every fantascientific thing that cross my path. At that point, it was obvious to me that I was meant for the Engineering life!</p> <p>But you may ask “Why Artificial Intelligence?” or “Why Reinforcement Learning?”. AI, in general, is the perfect match across all my interests (current, past and for sure future)! We can apply AI to almost every aspect of our life, and if there are some that still are not “AI-ed” we are working on how to do that! The idea that we are just scratching the surface of the the AI era gives me zoomies every time!</p> <p>For the second question, I will cut short by asking you a counter-question: have you ever heard about Isaac Asimov and most of all about Alan Turing? Well, if yes, you can easily understand what truly lies behind my “zoomies”. Questions like “Could machines think at some point?” or “what humanity can achive with machines-empowerment?” hold me tight to the chair for hours every day, and this is were Reinforcement Learning kicks in! It has been demonstrated as one of the most complex learning processes but also one of the most powerful! Humans and animals are guided by Reinforcement Learning even if we still do not know what is the true Reward Function…</p> <p>What can I say more about me?</p> <ul> <li>I L O V E the Lord of the Rings, and after years of re-watch, conferences about LoTR and scraping the LoTR Wiki, this year I committed myself into finally reading all the books. If Gondor calls for aid, Rohan will answer.</li> <li>Since Christmas 1999, when I received my PlayStation, I have been a relentless videogamer. My problem is that I like challenging games, so yeah… I am “quite” a Souls-like gamer.</li> <li>I played guitar for years but my sound was not so rocky as I wanted.. Thus, after fooling with drums during a jam session with friends, I understood that kicking and hitting things with sticks was my real thing. So after years of dreaming to have a drums set, years spent in hitting sofa pillows with sticks to still learn some fills, this year I finally got my very own drums set! I wanna rock.. ROCK!</li> <li>During the last year, I played Dungeons and Dragons for the first time.. I think that you already discovered the pattern behind all my hobbies.. What are the consequences of adding D&amp;D into my life? Well, 1. new fantasy books to read; 2. tons of manuals to buy; 3. infinite characters to create. Bringing and living fantasy stories into real life with my friends has no price!</li> <li>Last but definitily not the least, I have been with my beautiful girlfriend, Giulia, for almost 10 years. We live together in Florence and we work every day more for our future. Yeah, that’s clear at this point that I am a commitment guy.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%63%61%72%6C%6F.%72%6F%6D%65%6F.%34%32%37@%67%6D%61%69%6C.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/CarloRomeo427" title="GitHub" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/" title="LinkedIn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WsjldWkAAAAJ&amp;hl" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note">You can even add a little note about which of these is the best way to reach you. </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Carlo Romeo.
